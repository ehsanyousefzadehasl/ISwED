# Image Segmentation with Encoder Decoders
This repository contains the documentation and source code for experiments with encoder decoder modesl for image segmentation on different datasets.

## Background
Computer vision is a sub-field in computer science field aiming at gathering, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images and extracting information that can be used by numerical decision-making processes.

### Definition
The process of partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments (image regions, image objects), which indeed are sets of pixels. In other words, image segmentation can be viewed as pixel labeling too.

### Goal
Simplify the representation of a digital image into something easier to understand and analyze. 

### Domain and Applications
1. Content-based image retrieval: finding similar images sharing the similar objects
2. Machine vision (Industrial) different from computer vision
3. Medical Imaging
4. Object detection tasks
    - Face detection
    - Pedestrain detection
    - Locating specific objects in satelite images
5. Recognition tasks
    - Face recognition
    - Fingerprint recognition
6. Traffic control systems
7. Video survelliance systems
8. etc.

### Traditional Computer Vision Approaches
- Thresholding method (changing a grayscale image into a binary image based a threshold)
    - maximum entropy method
    - balanced histogram thresholding
    - Otsu's method (maximum variance)
    - k-means clustering
- etc.
### DL-based Appoaches
- Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)
## Evaluation Metrics
## Encoder-Decoder based DL Models

## Image Segmentation Datasets
The datasets for this task:
1. CamVids
